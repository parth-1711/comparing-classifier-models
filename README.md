# comparing-classifier-models

In this project, a notebook is formed where classifiers are built to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

A historical dataset from previous loan applications is loaded, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. Algorithms used for this project are:

  -->k-Nearest Neighbour

  -->Decision Tree

  -->Support Vector Machine

  -->Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

  -->Jaccard index

  -->F1-score

  -->LogLoass
